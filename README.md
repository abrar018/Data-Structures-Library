# Data Structures Library

This project is a collection of common data structures implemented in Python.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a library for common data structures, including linear data structures, tree structures, vector-based heaps, and graph algorithms.

## Implementation

The library will be created using Java and organized into the following structure:

- `myLib` package
  - `Datastructures` subfolder
    - `Linear` subfolder
      - `SinglyLinkedList (SLL)`
      - `DoublyLinkedList (DLL)`
      - `CircularLinkedList (CSLL)`
      - `CircularDoublyLinkedList (CDLL)`
      - `Stack`
      - `Queue`
    - `Trees` subfolder
      - `BinarySearchTrees (BST)`
      - `AVL`
    - `Heaps` subfolder
      - `MaxHeap` and `MinHeap`
      - `Heapsort` static function
    - `Nodes` subfolder
      - Node classes for various data structures
  - `Graphalgo` subfolder
    - `GraphAlgorithms` static class with methods:
      - `BFS`
      - `DFS`
      - `Dijkstra`
